## to do list  we will need to generate training_volume_3.txt


#### step 1.  NOTES seg_liver_train.py


## train_file
## val_file
## requires database_root

## Three main Variables
    ## global_step ??? 
    ## learning_rate ????
    ## segmentation.train(dataset)

#### step 1. seg_liver_train.py
I - training_volume_3.txt, testing_volume_3
 seg_liver - inputs tensorflow placeholder that contains input image
O - tensor of the network, end_points


### step 2. det_lesion_train.py

## dataset class  - dataset_det_data_aug
    train_list: TXT file with the path to the images to use for training (Images must be between 0 and 255)
        test_list: TXT file with the path to the images to use for testing (Images must be between 0 and 255)
        database_root: Path to the root of the Database
        store_memory: True stores all the training images, False loads at runtime the images

    I - train_file_pos, train_file_neg, val_file_pos, val_file_neg 
    O - LOADS all data into memory Started loading training files... ,Started loading validation files... 
          Started loading testing files... Done initializing Dataset

## detection.train
    I- global_step, weights, learning_rate, logs_path, max_training_iters, 

        dataset: Reference to a Dataset object instance
        initial_ckpt: Path to the checkpoint to initialize the network (May be parent network or pre-trained Imagenet)
        supervison: Level of the side outputs supervision: 1-Strong 2-Weak 3-No supervision
        learning_rate: Value for the learning rate. It can be number or an instance to a learning rate object.
        logs_path: Path to store the checkpoints
        max_training_iters: Number of training iterations
        save_step: A checkpoint will be created every save_steps
        display_step: Information of the training will be displayed every display_steps
        global_step: Reference to a Variable that keeps track of the training steps
        iter_mean_grad: Number of gradient computations that are average before updating the weights
        batch_size:
        momentum: Value of the momentum parameter for the Momentum optimizer
        resume_training: Boolean to try to restore from a previous checkpoint (True) or not (False)
        config: Reference to a Configuration object used in the creation of a Session
        finetune: Use to select to select type of training, 0 for the parent network and 1 for finetunning

    O-
